Quakechasm (formerly DarkChronics-Quake) is a feature-rich implementation of the Quake minigame for modern Minecraft servers running Paper. Built from the ground up with extensibility, versatility, and entertainment value at its core, Quakechasm brings the authentic Quake experience to Minecraft like never before.

## Why Quakechasm over other Quake plugins?

While other Quake plugins take inspiration from Hypixel's simplified interpretation, Quakechasm draws directly from id Software's legendary Quake series, specifically Quake 3 Arena and Quake Live. This isn't just another instagib clone; it's a faithful recreation of classic arena FPS gameplay in Minecraft.

Quakechasm implements mechanics from Quake 3/Live that are not found in any other Minecraft Quake plugin:

- 7 iconic weapons from the Quake lineup, such as the Rocket Launcher, Railgun, and BFG (unlike the instagib-focused approach of other plugins)
- 3 powerups, including the iconic Quad Damage, that give your player buffs or defensive stats for a short period of time
- Health and armor pickups for additional protection, with factors based off of Quake 3 itself
- Mobility mechanics such as Slipgate teleporters, jumppads and rocketjumping
- 3 distinct game modes: Free For All, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag
- Custom HUD with weapon info, ammo counter, and powerup timers
- Visual particles and customizable sounds for extra flavor
- Multi-team spawnpoint system for different game modes
- Custom death messages inspired by the Quake games
- ... and potentially more to come!

**This plugin is under development.** Expect bugs and stability issues as Quakechasm is being refined and expanded. Your feedback is appreciated!
